# The Intern Academy Tasks

The Intern Academy Tasks repository contains a collection of projects completed during the Data Science and Machine Learning Internship at The Intern Academy in July 2021. These projects showcase the application of Python and Machine Learning concepts in real-world scenarios and provide hands-on experience in data analysis, disease detection, and digit prediction.

## Projects Included

1. Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the famous Titanic dataset to gain insights into the passengers' information, survival rates, and factors affecting survival. Perform data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and correlations in the data.

2. Parkinson's Disease Detection: Develop a machine learning model to detect Parkinson's disease based on speech features. Utilize the Parkinson's Telemonitoring Dataset to train and evaluate the model's performance, implementing classification algorithms and feature selection techniques.

3. Handwritten Digit Prediction: Build a machine learning model to recognize and predict handwritten digits. Utilize the MNIST dataset, preprocess the images, and apply classification algorithms to achieve accurate digit recognition. Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the predictions.
